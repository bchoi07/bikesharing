## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to present bike trip analysis for a potential bike-sharing program in Des Moines. Visualizations were created in Tableau using NYC Citibike data, and a story was created that showed these images.

## Summary

Overall, we see a few patterns emerge from the analysis done. First, most riders are subscribers and male. Also, the peak hours correlate with work hours, with a peak from 5-6pm and 7-8am. This shows users might be riding bikes to work. Finally, splitting the data between gender does not show any huge differences between the groups. 

Two additional visualization I would do would be a heat map of riding hours per day for different categories of subscription (subscriber or customer) and a line plot showing the distribution of riders' age. By doing these, we can get information about the habits of subscribers versus customers and get a sense of the riders' demographics.
